      <h2>About ExaWorks</h2>
			<p>The convergence of traditional High Performance Computing (HPC) and new simulation, analysis,
and data science approaches provides unprecedented opportunities for discovery but also creates
new application and infrastructure challenges. Several ECP workflows exemplify this new reality:
a heterogeneous combination of applications, models, and "glue" code, running on heterogeneous
compute nodes with machine learning in the middle, and a scalable workflow infrastructure orchestrating
the entire process. At extreme scale, these workflows will almost certainly require
specialized workflow management software which is within the reach of only large and specialized
inter-disciplinary teams. Historically, such approaches have tended to result in complex, integrated,
and stovepiped software systems. Further, there are now hundreds of moribund workflow systems,
which indicates that many teams, small and large, elect to build their own custom workflow solution
rather than adopt, or build upon, an integrated system. </p>

<p>ExaWorks represents a new approach: co-designing a set of shared components (the ExaWorks toolkit)
that can be combined to enable teams to produce scalable and portable workflows for a
wide range of exascale applications. ExaWorks does not aim to replace the many workflow solutions already
deployed and used by scientists, but rather to provide well-defined and scalable components which
can be leveraged by new and existing workflows. Most importantly, this toolkit will enable a sustainable
software infrastructure for workflows so that the software artifacts produced by teams will
be easier to port, modify, and utilize long after projects end. These components will be usable by
many other WMS thus facilitating software convergence in the workflows community. </p>

<p>The major aims of the project are to</p>
    
	    <ol> 
				<li>Create the ExaWorks Toolkit with well-defined component interfaces and reference
				implementations to support integration and interoperation with existing WMSs and to enable
				application developers to build upon hardened components to create customizable workflow
				solutions.</li>
				<li>Community engagement with the ECP applications, workflows, and facility communities
				to harmonize the disparate and stovepiped workflow landscape, ensure ExaWorks components
				and WMSs operate on exascale systems, and to create resources to support ECP applications
				and workflow users. </li>
				<li>Research and development activities that will ensure that exascale workflows can be efficiently
				deployed on exascale systems and meet exascale-specific workflow challenges, such
				as providing high performance and scalable workflow execution, scheduling heterogeneous
				workloads on heterogeneous systems, enabling flexible and granular communication and coordination,
				and automatically detecting and recovering from faults.</li>
