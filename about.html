      <h2>About ExaWorks</h2>
			<p>The convergence of traditional High Performance Computing (HPC) and new simulation, analysis,
and data science approaches provides unprecedented opportunities for discovery but also creates
new application and infrastructure challenges. Several ECP workflows exemplify this new reality:
a heterogeneous combination of applications, models, and "glue" code, running on heterogeneous
compute nodes with machine learning in the middle, and a scalable workflow infrastructure orchestrating
the entire process. At extreme scale, these workflows will almost certainly require
specialized workflow management software which is within the reach of only large and specialized
inter-disciplinary teams. Historically, such approaches have tended to result in complex, integrated,
and stovepiped software systems. Further, there are now hundreds of moribund workflow systems,
which indicates that many teams, small and large, elect to build their own custom workflow solution
rather than adopt, or build upon, an integrated system. </p>

<p>ExaWorks represents a new approach: developing a multi-level SDK that will enable 
teams to produce scalable and portable workflows for a
wide range of exascale applications. ExaWorks does not aim to replace the many workflow solutions already
deployed and used by scientists, but rather to provide a robust SDK and work with the community
	to identify well-defined and scalable component interfaces which
can be leveraged by new and existing workflows. Most importantly, this SDK will enable a sustainable
software infrastructure for workflows so that the software artifacts produced by teams will
be easier to port, modify, and utilize long after projects end. SDK components will be usable by
many other WMS thus facilitating software convergence in the workflows community. </p>

<p>The major aims of the project are to</p>
    
	    <ol> 
				<li>Create the ExaWorks SDK following a community-oriented process. First defining a community
					policy for includsion in the SDK. Based on application requirements we will assemble
					a set of vertical workflow technologies (level 0), work to integrate those technlogies
					via existing native interfaces and shim layers (level 1), and collaborate to identify
					common component interfaces that can be used for interoperation between systems. </li>
				<li>Community engagement with the ECP applications, workflows, and facility communities
				to harmonize the disparate and stovepiped workflow landscape, ensure ExaWorks components
				and WMSs operate on exascale systems, and to create resources to support ECP applications
				and workflow users. </li>
